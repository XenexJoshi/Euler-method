Euler Methods:

This program offers a numerical solution to first-order differential equations in the form of y' = P(y) + P(t) + Ae^(a*t) + Be^(b*t). The resulting Euler approximation along with an approximation step-wise sketch of the graph is shown after running the program.

To run the program, navigate to the program directory Euler-approximation-web and run the following in the terminal:

   npm install
   npm run dev

Required modules before running program:

   react-plotly.js

To install react-plotly, run:

   npm install react-plotly.js plotly.js
